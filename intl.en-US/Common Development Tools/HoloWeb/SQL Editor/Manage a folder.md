This topic describes how to create, rename, delete, and search for a folder in the HoloWeb console.

You have logged on to a Hologres instance. For more information, see [Log on to an instance](/intl.en-US/Common Development Tools/HoloWeb/Connection Management/Log on to an instance.md).

## Create a folder

1.  Log on to the [Hologres console](https://hologram.console.aliyun.com/#/instance).

2.  In the top navigation bar, select a region from the drop-down list.

3.  On the **Hologres Instances** page, click **Go to HoloWeb** to go to the HoloWeb console.

4.  In the HoloWeb console, choose **SQL Editor** \> **Create Folder** in the top navigation bar.

    You can also right-click **My SQL query** in the left-side navigation pane and select **New folder**. HoloWeb allows you to create a subfolder in an existing folder.

5.  In the **New folder** dialog box, set the **Folder Name** and **Directory** parameters.

    You can select an existing directory from the drop-down list to place the new folder.

6.  Click **OK**. The new folder is displayed in the specified directory in the left-side navigation pane.


## Rename a folder

1.  In the left-side navigation pane, click **My SQL query**. All the created folders are displayed.

2.  Right-click the folder that you want to rename and select **Rename folder**.

3.  Enter an updated name in the **Rename name** field based on your business requirements.

4.  Click **OK**.


## Delete a folder

1.  In the left-side navigation pane, click **My SQL query**. All the created folders are displayed.

2.  Right-click the folder that you want to delete and select **Delete folder**.

    **Note:** Before you delete a folder, you must delete all subfolders and SQL query tasks in the folder.

3.  Click **OK**.


## Search for a folder

The **My SQL query** list may contain a lot of folders and SQL query tasks. To find a folder within a short period of time, perform the following steps:

1.  In the left-side navigation pane, enter a keyword in the search box below **Query**.

    ![Query](https://static-aliyun-doc.oss-accelerate.aliyuncs.com/assets/img/en-US/7267993261/p274941.png)

2.  The folders whose names contain the keyword are displayed in the **My SQL query** list.
